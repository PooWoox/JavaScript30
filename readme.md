# JavaScript30
Repository with all 30 JavaScript challenges I'll be following through on the next (hopefully) 30 days. This is for solidifying my pure JavaScript skills and maybe discover things I haven't yet tried and also for testing out a new discipline approach on learning.

You can also grab this course with the challenges at [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com)
